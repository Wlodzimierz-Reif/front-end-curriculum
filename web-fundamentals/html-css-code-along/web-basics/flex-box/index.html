        </header>
        <p>
          Here at <strong>Guinea pigs 4 rent</strong>, we believe noone should
          be restricted from having a piggy friend. We supply Guinea pigs to
          people who are unable to look after a pet full time. Our pricing
          models are per day, week or month. All Guinea pigs are avalaible for
          purchase if you decide you don't want to part with your piggy friend.
