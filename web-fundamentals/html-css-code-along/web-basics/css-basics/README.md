# CSS basics code along

## Guideline steps for the code along

1. Create link to css file and css file.

2. Set nav background colour and see the spacing around the nav. also add hover to nav to show it could be clickable.

3. Remove the margin on the body tag.

4. Set header colour and see that it applies to all headers. Then create class to apply to one header.

5. Give main some padding.

6. float main and aside left so they sit side by side. see that the footer will now sometimes drift up.

7. apply clear left to the footer to make sure it appears after main.

8. As an added feature you can introduce media queries to make the content 100% when below a set width (though this can wait till week 2)
